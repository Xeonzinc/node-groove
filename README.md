# node-groove

Node.js bindings to [libgroove](https://github.com/andrewrk/libgroove) -
generic music player backend library.

Live discussion in `#libgroove` on [freenode](https://freenode.net/).

## Usage

1. Install libgroove to your system. libgroove is a set of 4 libraries;
   node-groove depends on all of them. So for example on ubuntu, make sure to
   install libgroove-dev, libgrooveplayer-dev, libgrooveloudness-dev, and
   libgroovefingerprinter-dev.
2. `npm install --save groove`

### Ubuntu 18.04

libgroove is hard to get in Ubuntu 18.04. Follow these instructions:

* https://github.com/andrewrk/libgroove/blob/4.3.x/README.md#ubuntu-1804
* https://github.com/andrewrk/libgroove/blob/4.3.x/README.md#building-with-a-locally-built-libav

To build this module from source, edit `binding.gyp` and make these modifications:

* Add an entry to the beginning of `"libraries"` that is `"-L{YOUR-HOME-DIRECTORY-HERE}/local/lib",`,
  for example `"-L/home/josh/local/lib",`.
* Add a new option: `"cflags": ["-I{YOUR-HOME-DIRECTORY-HERE}/local/include"],`,
  for example `"cflags": ["-I/home/josh/local/include"],`.

Then running `npm install` should work.

### Versions

 * node-groove >=2.4.0 depends on libgroove >=4.3.0
 * use node-groove 2.3.4 if you want to use libgroove <4.3.0

### Get Metadata from File

```js
var groove = require('groove');

groove.open("danse-macabre.ogg", function(err, file) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(file.metadata());
  console.log("duration:", file.duration());
  file.close(function(err) {
    if (err) throw err;
  });
});
```

#### More Examples

 * example/metadata.js - read or update metadata in a media file
 * example/playlist.js - play several files in a row and then exit
 * example/replaygain.js - compute replaygain values for media files
 * example/transcode.js - convert and splice several files together
 * example/fingerprint.js - create an acoustid fingerprint for media files

## API Documentation

### globals

#### groove.setLogging(level)

`level` can be:

 * `groove.LOG_QUIET`
 * `groove.LOG_ERROR`
 * `groove.LOG_WARNING`
 * `groove.LOG_INFO`

#### groove.loudnessToReplayGain(loudness)

Converts a loudness value which is in LUFS to the ReplayGain-suggested dB
adjustment.

#### groove.dBToFloat(dB)

Converts dB format volume adjustment to a floating point gain format.

#### groove.getVersion()

Returns an object with these properties:

 * `major`
 * `minor`
 * `patch`

### GrooveFile

#### groove.open(filename, callback)

`callback(err, file)`

#### file.close(callback)

`callback(err)`

#### file.duration()

In seconds.

#### file.shortNames()

A comma-separated list of short names for the format.

#### file.getMetadata(key, [flags])

Flags:

 * `groove.TAG_MATCH_CASE`
 * `groove.TAG_DONT_OVERWRITE`
 * `groove.TAG_APPEND`

#### file.setMetadata(key, value, [flags])

See `getMetadata` for flags.

Pass `null` for `value` to delete a key.

#### file.metadata()

This returns an object populated with all the metadata.
Updating the object does nothing. Use `setMetadata` to
update metadata and then `save` to write changes to disk.

#### file.dirty

Boolean whether `save` will do anything.

#### file.filename

The string that was passed to `groove.open`

#### file.save(callback)

`callback(err)`

### GroovePlaylist

#### groove.createPlaylist()

A playlist managers keeping an audio buffer full. To send the buffer
to your speakers, use `playlist.createPlayer()`.

#### playlist.items()

Returns a read-only array of playlist items.
Use `playlist.insert` and `playlist.remove` to modify.

`[playlistItem1, playlistItem2, ...]`

#### playlist.play()

#### playlist.pause()

#### playlist.seek(playlistItem, position)

Seek to `playlistItem`, `position` seconds into the song.

#### playlist.insert(file, gain, peak, nextPlaylistItem)

Creates a new playlist item with file and puts it in the playlist before
`nextPlaylistItem`. If `nextPlaylistItem` is `null`, appends the new
item to the playlist.

`gain` is a float format volume adjustment that applies only to this item.
defaults to 1.0

`peak` is float format, see `item.peak`.
defaults to 1.0

Returns the newly added playlist item.

Once you add a file to the playlist, you must not `file.close()` it until
you first remove it from the playlist.

#### playlist.remove(playlistItem)

Remove `playlistItem` from the playlist.

Note that you are responsible for calling `file.close()` on every file
that you open with `groove.open`. `playlist.remove` will not close files.

#### playlist.position()

Returns `{item, pos}` where `item` is the playlist item currently being
decoded and `pos` is how many seconds into the song the decode head is.

Note that typically you are more interested in the position of the play head,
not the decode head. Example methods which return the play head are
`player.position()` and `encoder.position()`.

#### playlist.playing()

Returns `true` or `false`.

#### playlist.clear()

Remove all playlist items.

#### playlist.count()

How many items are on the playlist.

#### playlist.gain

#### playlist.setGain(value)

Between 0.0 and 1.0. You probably want to leave this at 1.0, since using
replaygain will typically lower your volume a significant amount.

#### playlist.setItemGain(playlistItem, gain)

`gain` is a float that affects the volume of the specified playlist item only.
To convert from dB to float, use exp(log(10) * 0.05 * dBValue).

#### playlist.setItemPeak(playlistItem, peak)

See `item.peak`

#### playlist.setFillMode(mode)

`mode` can be:

 * `groove.EVERY_SINK_FULL`

    This is the default behavior. The playlist will decode audio if any sinks
    are not full. If any sinks do not drain fast enough the data will buffer up
    in the playlist.

 * `groove.ANY_SINK_FULL`

    With this behavior, the playlist will stop decoding audio when any attached
    sink is full, and then resume decoding audio every sink is not full.

Defaults to `groove.EVERY_SINK_FULL`.

### GroovePlaylistItem

These are not instantiated directly; instead they are returned from
`playlist.items()`.

#### item.file

Read-only.

#### item.gain

A volume adjustment in float format to apply to the file when it plays.
This is typically used for loudness compensation, for example ReplayGain.
To convert from dB to float, use `groove.dBToFloat`

Read-only. Use `playlist.setItemGain` to modify.

#### item.peak

The sample peak of this playlist item is assumed to be 1.0 in float
format. If you know for certain that the peak is less than 1.0, you
may set this value which may allow the volume adjustment to use
a pure amplifier rather than a compressor. This results in slightly
better audio quality.

Read-only. Use `playlist.setItemPeak` to modify.

#### item.id

Every time you obtain a playlist item from groove, you will get a fresh
JavaScript object, but it might point to the same underlying libgroove pointer
as another. The `id` field is a way to check if two playlist items reference
the same one.

Read-only.

### GroovePlayer

#### groove.getDevices()

Returns an array of device names which are the devices you can send audio
to.

#### groove.createPlayer()

Creates a GroovePlayer instance which you can then configure by setting
properties.

#### player.deviceIndex

Before calling `attach()`, set this to the index of one of the devices
returned from `groove.getDevices()` or `null` to represent the default device.
Use `groove.DUMMY_DEVICE` to represent a dummy audio player.

#### player.targetAudioFormat

The desired audio format settings with which to open the device.
`groove.createPlayer()` defaults these to 44100 Hz,
signed 16-bit int, stereo.
These are preferences; if a setting cannot be used, a substitute will
be used instead. In this case, actualAudioFormat will be updated to reflect
the substituted values.

Properties:

 * `sampleRate`
 * `channelLayout`
 * `sampleFormat`

#### player.actualAudioFormat

groove sets this to the actual format you get when you open the device.
Ideally will be the same as targetAudioFormat but might not be.

Properties:

 * `sampleRate`
 * `channelLayout`
 * `sampleFormat`

#### player.deviceBufferSize

how big the device buffer should be, in sample frames.
must be a power of 2.
`groove.createPlayer()` defaults this to 1024

#### player.sinkBufferSize

How big the sink buffer should be, in sample frames.
`groove.createPlayer()` defaults this to 8192

#### player.useExactAudioFormat

If you set this to `true`, `targetAudioFormat` and `actualAudioFormat` are
ignored and no resampling, channel layout remapping, or sample format
conversion will occur. The audio device will be reopened with exact parameters
whenever necessary.

#### player.attach(playlist, callback)

Sends audio to sound device.

`callback(err)`

#### player.detach(callback)

`callback(err)`

#### player.position()

Returns `{item, pos}` where `item` is the playlist item currently being
played and `pos` is how many seconds into the song the play head is.

#### player.on('nowplaying', handler)

Fires when the item that is now playing changes. It can be `null`.

`handler()`

#### player.on('bufferunderrun', handler)

Fires when a buffer underrun occurs. Ideally you'll never see this.

`handler()`

#### player.on('devicereopened', handler)

Fires when you have set `useExactAudioFormat` to `true` and the audio device
has been closed and re-opened to match incoming audio data.

`handler()`

### GrooveEncoder
